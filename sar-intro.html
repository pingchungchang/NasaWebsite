                <h2>Introduction to SAR</h2>
                <p class='description-block'>
						Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a satellite technology that uses radar signals to capture detailed images of the Earth’s surface. Unlike optical imagery, SAR captures surface characteristics such as terrain, vegetation, and soil moisture, and has applications in monitoring icebergs, oil spills, and wetlands. By comparing images taken before and after an event, SAR helps detect areas affected by water, soil movement, or surface changes. It also operates independently of weather or daylight, offering millimeter-level precision, wide-area coverage, and the ability to track long-term environmental changes.

                <p class='description-block'>
						By defining the transmitted and received polarizations of SAR, we can better interpret features on Earth’s surface. There are four common polarization combinations: VV, VH, HH, and HV. The first letter denotes the transmitted polarization and the second indicates the received one.
				</p>
                <p class='description-block'>
						VV polarization means that the radar transmits and receives vertically polarized waves. It is particularly sensitive to surface scattering, where signals reflect off smooth surfaces such as buildings or bodies of water. VV data are especially useful in agriculture, crop monitoring, and land cover classification for detecting variations in terrain smoothness.
