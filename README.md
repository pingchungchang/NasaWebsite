# Disaster Observation Platform

[Page Link](https://astroblob012.github.io/SAR/)

This project was developed for the **2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge**. 
We explore our chosen study area using **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** data to discover the physical features after a natural disaster.

### Study area:
- 2025 Fataâ€™an Barrier Lake, Hualien County, Taiwan
- 2025 Pakistan Flood: Indus River, Tarbela Dam, and the town of Khairabad.
- 2023 Quebec Wildfire, Canada

### Our hypothesis: 
 In SAR imagery, the amount of energy received by the satellite depends on the roughness of the surface.
 When the surface is smooth, such as a body of water, most of the radar signal is reflected away from the satellite, resulting in low backscatter and a darker appearance in the image. In contrast, rough surfaces like forests or mountains cause multiple scattering and reflect more energy back to the satellite, appearing brighter.
 By observing these differences, we can identify changes in terrain and distinguish between water bodies and land or vegetation-covered areas.
